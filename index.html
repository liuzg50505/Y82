                            Sugarcane originally originated in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, especially in
                            regions like New Guinea, India, Bangladesh, and Malaysia, where it grew naturally in the
                            tropical climate. In the 7th century, Arab merchants brought sugarcane cultivation
                            techniques to the Middle East and North Africa. Sugarcane was further promoted and improved,
                            and the process of extracting sugar was developed. The Arabs made several improvements to
                            the methods of producing sugar syrup and sugar, making it widely popular in the region.

                            Later, the techniques of sugarcane cultivation and sugar production gradually spread to
                            Western Europe, particularly to Spain and Portugal. During the Middle Ages, European
                            societies began to learn about and adopt sugarcane sugar-making technology, although the
                            spread of this knowledge was initially slow.

                        <p>In the 19th century, with the advancement of industrialization and the growing demand for
                            sugar, the cultivation of sugarcane and sugar production expanded further into more tropical
                            regions, including the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia, South Asia, and Africa. By the end
                            of the 19th century, European countries established large sugarcane plantations, especially
                            in Asia, the Caribbean, and South America. As technology improved and the demand for sugar
                            increased, sugarcane not only became the main source of sugar globally, but also led to the
                            production of many industrial by-products, such as molasses and alcohol.

                            Nowadays, sugarcane is grown almost everywhere in the tropics and subtropics, especially in
                            countries such as Brazil, India, China, Thailand and Australia, which remain the world
                            largest sugarcane producers. With the growing demand for bioenergy, sugarcane is also widely
                            used to produce alternative energy sources such as ethanol.

                            Sugarcane cultivation was closely associated with the slave trade, especially in the
                            Caribbean,
                            South America, the southern United States and some parts of Asia and Africa. From the 16th
                            century onwards, sugarcane cultivation expanded rapidly in the European colonies and became
                            a
                            central industry in sugar production.

                            Sugar was favoured by the European aristocracy as a luxury item and demand gradually
                            increased.
                            To meet this demand, the colonies needed a large labour force. To meet the demand for labour
                            on
                            the sugar plantations, the European colonists initiated the massive transatlantic slave
                            trade.
                            This trade transported thousands of African slaves from the coast of West Africa to the
                            Americas.

                            The slaves were forced to labour on sugarcane plantations, in sugar mills, mines and other
                            economic activities. These African slaves were forced to work in the cultivation of
                            sugarcane
                            and the refining of sugar under extremely harsh labour conditions, which resulted in an
                            extremely high mortality rate.

                            Sugarcane plantations in the Caribbean, Brazil and South America became the centres of world
                            sugar production, and the economies of these regions depended almost exclusively on
                            sugarcane

                            The most famous use of sugarcane is the extraction of sugar. Around 500 B.C., the Indians
                            had
                            learnt to extract sugar from sugarcane and had invented preliminary methods of refining
                            sugar.
                            Demand for sugar grew rapidly in the 16th century with the increased demand for the sweet
                            flavour in Europe.
                        </p>
                        <p>From the 16th to the 18th centuries, sugar production moved on a large scale into the
                            Americas,
                            the Caribbean, and South Asia as European colonial expansion established sugarcane-based
                            plantation economies.
                        </p>
                        <p>Sugar mills in these regions facilitated the industrialisation of sugar production through
                            the
                            use of large amounts of slave labour. Sugar became an important commodity in global trade,
                            and
                            the sugar mills as well as the sugarcane plantations were important pillars of the colonial
                            economy.
                        </p>
                        <p>With technological advances and industrialisation, sugar mills gradually evolved from small
                            artisanal workshops to large-scale production enterprises.

                    After the sugarcane is transported from the plantations to the sugar mills, it needs to be processed
                    through a number of steps, such as pressing, boiling and crystallisation, a process that requires a
                    large amount of labour. Negroes were mainly engaged in cleaning, carrying, boiling and filtering in
                    the
                    sugar mills, operating high-temperature equipment and facing great health risks. Sugar production
                    was
                    gradually mechanised, especially in the 19th century, when sugar mills began to adopt modern
                    equipment.
                    This mechanised production not only increased sugar yields, but also reduced production costs,
                    allowing
                    sugar to begin to move from a luxury product to a mass consumer product. With the development of
                    sugar
                    production technology, it gradually became an important commodity in global trade.

                            Rum is an alcoholic beverage whose origins can be traced back to the Caribbean in the 17th
                            century. In the beginning, rum production was invented by colonists in the Caribbean. These
                            colonists discovered that molasses, a by-product of sugar cane, could be fermented and
                            distilled
                            to produce a drink with an alcoholic content. As rum production expanded in the Caribbean,
                            the
                            demand for rum grew rapidly in the European market.

                        <p>Especially in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, rum became one of the most important
                            commodities for maritime trade and navigation in Britain, France and Spain. Sailors and
                            merchants at sea also often used rum as a regular drink. Many crews carried rum as a
                            substitute
                            for water during the voyage, as it could be preserved for long periods of time and was
                            thought

                Between the early 1960s and 2020, the total area planted with sugarcane world-wide increased fourfold,
                with numerous impacts on the territories concerned: displacement of activities and communities, land
                tenure and fresh water supply issues, risks of exclusion for vulnerable population groups and threats to
                food security. In a context of global change and climate change, the sugarcane value chain also faces a
                number of challenges. On a bio-physical and technological level, there is a need to adapt sugarcane
                growing methods, to preserve soils, biodiversity and water resources and reduce chemical and atmospheric
                pollution.

                From a socioeconomic, political and institutional point of view, developing new sugarcane products
                changes traditional structures and raises a range of questions in terms of economic and social
                sustainability. There are many different visions of sugarcane cultivation: numerous countries (the US
                and Latin American countries) rely on continued intensive pesticide use, with the creation of
                genetically modified varieties resistant to pests and diseases or glyphosate (herbicide) for instance.
                Europe (in its ultraperipheral regions) favours more environmentally friendly agriculture, with ever
                less pesticide use and the development of agroecological practices, along with molecular marker assisted
                breeding operations to produce orange rust-resistant varieties, for instance. The situation varies in
                Africa, according to how dependent producing countries are on the sugar market, to their production
                structure (sugar companies, small scale producers, or a mix of the two), to how developed the industrial
                and research sectors are, etc.

                    particularly in countries like Brazil, which have large-scale sugarcane production and advanced
                    biofuel industries. Unlike petroleum-based fuels, sugarcane biofuel is renewable and can be
                    produced continuously as long as sugarcane is grown and harvested. This reduces dependence on
                    finite fossil fuel resources. It is highly energy-efficient, and sustainable, and significantly
                    reduces greenhouse gas emissions when compared to fossil fuels.
